However, it was unexpected that the job growth rate was low in many of the higher earning fields. We can conclude that most high paying jobs (90k<) have an entry-level education requirement of Bachelors degreee and highere. Additionally, we can conclude That there is an expected decline in job growth under the bachelors degree level."
